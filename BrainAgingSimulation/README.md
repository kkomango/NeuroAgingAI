# Brain Aging Simulation

This folder contains research on brain aging simulation using conditional GANs (cGAN). The study focuses on generating age-progressed brain images based on gender and age conditions.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Generative_Brain_Aging.ipynb`: Conditional GAN training for brain aging simulation, including visualization of age-progressed brain images.


## How to Use
1. Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions for data loading, training, and visualization.
3. View the simulated aging results.

## Results
The results of the simulations and visualizations are stored in the `Results` folder.
